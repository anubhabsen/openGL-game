Scoring System
==============

* The score begins at 20 and game is over when it reaches negative.
* Collecting right coloured block in right basket gives 10 points, incorrect colour gives -2 and decrements health by 5
* Shooting the black coloured blocks fetch 10 points and other blocks fetch -5
* Initial health is 100 and game is over when it reaches 0
* When the block is missed and reaches the very end of the screen (-5), -1 points are given
* The baskets when overlapped dont collect blocks
